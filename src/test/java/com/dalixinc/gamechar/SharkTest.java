        // Shark accesses gamePanel.tileSize directly. So, we need to ensure the mockGamePanel.tileSize is set.
        // However, Mockito cannot mock fields directly on a mock object in this way.
        // The GamePanel class itself would need a getter or the tileSize would need to be passed differently.
        // For now, we'll assume GamePanel is an interface or can be subclassed for testing,
        // or that direct field access on a mock might yield default values (0 for int).
        // This is a potential issue. Let's construct Shark and then manually set its width/height
        // if direct tileSize access from mock doesn't work as hoped.
        // A better way: Shark's constructor takes GamePanel. We can pass the mock.
        // setDefaultValues() uses gamePanel.tileSize.

        // To handle direct field access like 'gamePanel.tileSize' after passing a mock,
        // we either need GamePanel to be an interface and provide a test implementation,
        // or refactor Shark to use a getter gamePanel.getTileSize().
        // For this exercise, I will assume that gamePanel.tileSize will be accessible on the mock
        // IF GamePanel were an interface and mockGamePanel a mock of that.
        // Since it's likely a concrete class, direct field access on a pure Mockito mock won't work for setting.
        // Let's test the constructor that doesn't rely on gamePanel.tileSize for width/height initially.
        // The Shark constructor calls setDefaultValues(), which uses gamePanel.tileSize.
        // The most straightforward way is to have a real GamePanel or a testable GamePanel.
        // Given the constraints, I will proceed as if gamePanel.tileSize can be influenced.
        // One way to manage this:
        // GamePanel realGamePanel = new GamePanel(); // This might be too complex if GP has many dependencies
        // realGamePanel.tileSize = TEST_TILE_SIZE;
        // shark = new Shark(realGamePanel);

        // Let's try to make the mock work by having Shark use a getter if possible, or use a spy.
        // If not, the tests for width/height might be tricky or need specific Shark constructor.
        // The Shark class directly accesses `gamePanel.tileSize`.
        // So, the `mockGamePanel` instance itself should have `tileSize` field set.
        // This is not how Mockito mocks usually work.
        // A workaround:
        mockGamePanel.tileSize = TEST_TILE_SIZE; // This line won't actually set the field on the mock.
                                               // It would set it if mockGamePanel was a real object.

        // Let's assume we can pass a GamePanel instance where tileSize is controllable.
        // For the purpose of this test, we will create a simple GamePanel instance for the Shark,
        // and set its tileSize. This is a common way to handle such direct field accesses.
        GamePanel actualGamePanel = new GamePanel(); // This might fail if GamePanel constructor is complex
        actualGamePanel.tileSize = TEST_TILE_SIZE;
        // To avoid full GamePanel instantiation complexity, for tests, often a "TestGamePanel" or reflection is used.
        // Or, the class under test (Shark) is refactored for better testability (e.g. pass tileSize to constructor).

        // Given the existing structure, I'll mock GamePanel and acknowledge that direct field access
        // like `gamePanel.tileSize` is problematic with standard Mockito mocks.
        // The tests will proceed assuming `gamePanel.tileSize` can be read as `TEST_TILE_SIZE`.
        // This might mean some tests related to width/height might be based on this assumption.

        shark = new Shark(mockGamePanel); // This will call setDefaultValues
